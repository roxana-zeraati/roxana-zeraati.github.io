- title: Talk at INSPIRE Symposium
  date: 6 May 2024
  abstract: I was invited to give a talk at the 2024 INSPIRE Symposium, WashU, about our work on adaptive neural timescales during selective attention. It was super exciting to interact and learn from other INSPIRE speakers and the lively neuroscience community at WashU, highly recommend it!

- title: Contributed talk at Cosyne 2024
  date: 2 March 2024
  abstract: I gave a contributed talk at Cosyne 2024 main meeting about our recent work on how different learning curricula give rise to distinct mechanisms for performing long-memory tasks. You can watch the recorded video from the link above.

- title: Workshop at Bernstein Conference
  date: 29 September 2024
  abstract: Shervin Safavi and I are organizing an exciting workshop at the Bernstein Conference on “Computation across scales in brain and beyond” which brings together a broad group of computational and experimental neuroscientists studying distinct types of computation from the level of single neurons to the whole brain and even brain-body interactions.

- title: Talk at Cosyne 2024 workshops
  date: 4 March 2024
  abstract: I gave a talk at Cosyne 2024 workshop on "Brain-wide modeling in the era of large-scale recordings and high resolution multi-omics" about our recent collaboration with the International Brain Laboratory studying neural timescale across the mouse brain. You can watch the recorded video from the link above.

- title: Paper accepted to ICLR 2024
  date: 20 February 2024
  abstract: Our paper on curriculum learning for long-memory tasks is accepted to ICLR 2024. We found that slow timescales required for forming long memories arise from distinct mechanisms shaped by the curriculum by which RNNs learned the task.
