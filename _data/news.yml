- title: Paper accepted to ICLR 2024
  date: 20 February 2024
  abstract: Our paper on curriculum learning for long-memory tasks is accepted to ICLR 2024. We found that slow timescales required for forming long memories arise from distinct mechanisms shaped by the curriculum by which RNNs learned the task.
