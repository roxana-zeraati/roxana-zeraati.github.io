I am a PhD student in computational neuroscience at the University of TÃ¼bingen and Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. I started my scientific journey as a double-major bachelor student of physics and biomedical engineering and then moved to neuroscience for my master and PhD.

<p align ="justify">
 My research lies at the intersection of systems and computational neuroscience. I am generally interested in understanding how animals adaptively learn to modify their behavior according to environmental demands and offer a rich biological insight into the underlying machinery. For this purpose, I develop data analysis methods and computational models (inspired by physics, machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches) to link neural dynamics to brain computation and behavior.
